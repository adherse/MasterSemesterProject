# Motion estimation module for EPFL Racing Team
Alexandre Dherse, Optional Semester Project Git repository, EPFL 2020-2021



Implementation of an extended kalman filter to predict EPFL Racing Team car state.

The report and slides of the presentation are in the main folder.
The EKF_tests contains the notebook used to implement the filter and run tests and the Motion_estimation_EPFLR contains the adaptation of the code to integrate it as a module with EPFL Racing Team. The communication between modules is assured by the tcplib helper, written by Alex Unnervik.
